          They say that stranger’s soul is incomprehensible, but we can’t
          entirely agree with the statement. Most often we just don’t want to
          notice the obvious, pretending that it’s too personal matter or
          something of the kind. In fact, a human soul is not as dark as it
          seems. It is always ready and even willing to reveal its secrets to
          the confidant. As a rule, web community members having their own
          websites are open for communication, socialization and other things
          like that. Besides, personal websites serve as a kind of virtual CVs
          for their owners. Most often, if you are as sharp as a needle, seeing
          a person’s website, you’ll easily tell even more about site owner than
          he/she wanted to say.
